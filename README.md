Boost.MPI3 

Boost.MPI3 is not an official Boost library.
Boost.MPI3 is designed following the principles of Boost and the STL.

Boost.MPI3 is not a derivative of Boost.MPI.
It adds features which were missing in Boost.MPI (which only covers MPI-1), with an iterator based interface and MPI-3 features (RMA and Shared memory).
